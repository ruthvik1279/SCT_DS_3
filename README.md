# SCT_DS_3
Built a Decision Tree Classifier using the Bank Marketing dataset to predict whether a customer will purchase a product/service based on demographic and behavioral data. Implemented data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization to analyze decision-making patterns.
# Dataset Overview
- The dataset contains information about direct marketing campaigns conducted by a Portuguese banking institution.
# Features include:
- Age, Job, Marital status, Education
- Default status, Housing loan, Personal loan
- Contact type, Last contact duration, Month, Day of week
- Campaign information (#contacts, previous outcome)
- Socioeconomic indicators
# Target Variable:
- y → whether the client subscribed to a term deposit (yes/no)
# Project Workflow
- Data Collection – Import the dataset into the workspace.
- Data Preprocessing – Handle categorical variables, missing values, and prepare features.
- Model Training – Train a Decision Tree Classifier.
- Model Evaluation – Assess performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
- Visualization – Plot the decision tree to interpret decisions.
# Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
# Expected Outcomes
- Prediction of customer subscription (yes/no).
- Identification of most important features affecting decisions.
- Visualization of the decision-making process using a tree structure.
# Future Enhancements
- Perform hyperparameter tuning for better performance.
- Explore advanced models like Random Forest and XGBoost.
- Conduct feature importance and correlation analysis for deeper insights.
